This code suffers from a potential issue related to how PHP handles type juggling and loose comparisons. The function `checkValue` intends to check if the input `$value` is equal to 1 or '1'. However, PHP's loose comparison (`==`) can lead to unexpected results due to automatic type coercion.  If `$value` is a string like '1' or an integer 1, it will evaluate to true. But if `$value` is a different type like a boolean `true`, it will also evaluate to true because PHP converts `true` to 1 during comparison. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the intention is to strictly compare the type and value.
